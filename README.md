# REST-API

A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding. 

It is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting (CRUD operations) of operations concerning resources.

## Technologies used in this project

 1. ExpressJS
 2. NodeJS
 3. Postman

## How to bring the API into action

This API could be used as a package. For this project, we used postman to conduct the CRUD operation and test the functionality of our API. To get it into action in real life, it needs to be connected with a real database and installed in the project to be called and implemented.
